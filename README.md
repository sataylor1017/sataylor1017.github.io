# webpage
This is the code for Sam Taylor's personal webpage.

Please note, to anyone who may be looking at this repo (employers, friends, colleagues, etc.):

The coding within this webpage is primarily a compilation of code from open-source templates and similar sources, which I've jumbled together into something that works. **Temporarily.**

I built this site on short notice in my free time during the last semester of my senior year of college, trying to get together something to show off as a project portfolio. This being said, please judge me by the content of the site rather than the site itself.

Cheers,
-ST
